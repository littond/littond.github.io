- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices, from mobile to desktop
- **Blog System**: Markdown-based blog with filtering by tags
- **Projects Showcase**: Highlighting my work with descriptions and links
- **Static Generation**: Pre-renders to static HTML for optimal performance and SEO

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Styling**: CSS with custom properties for theming
- **Content**: Markdown with front matter for structured data
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## Development Setup

```bash

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. The build process optimizes all assets for production.
