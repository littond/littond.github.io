# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: Choosing the Right Layout Tool

When building modern web layouts, two CSS features stand out: Grid and Flexbox. Both are powerful tools, but they serve different purposes. This post explores the strengths of each and helps you decide which to use.

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout

Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts - either a row or a column. It's perfect for:

- Navigation menus
- Centering elements vertically and horizontally
- Distributing space between items in a single dimension
- Creating flexible item sizes that adapt to their content

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts - handling both rows and columns simultaneously. It's ideal for:

- Page layouts
- Card layouts
- Complex alignment where elements need to align in both directions
- Creating precise layout patterns

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
```

## When to Use Each

**Use Flexbox when:**
- You need a simple layout in a single dimension (row or column)
- You're working with a collection of similar-sized items
- You need to align items within a container

**Use Grid when:**
- You need to create a complex layout with rows and columns
- You want precise control over item placement
- You're creating an overall page layout

## The Best Approach: Use Both!

In many modern websites, the best approach is to use Grid for the main page layout, and Flexbox for the components within that layout. They complement each other perfectly.

For example:
- Use Grid to create the overall page sections
- Use Flexbox within those sections to arrange content

Remember that both Grid and Flexbox are responsive by nature, making them perfect for modern web development.
