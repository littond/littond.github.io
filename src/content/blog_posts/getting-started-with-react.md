# Getting Started with React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's declarative, efficient, and flexible, making it a great choice for modern web development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with React, you should have a good understanding of:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (particularly ES6+ features)

## Setting Up Your First React App

There are several ways to create a React application, but the easiest is to use Create React App.

### Using Create React App

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already
2. Open your terminal and run:

```
npx create-react-app my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React application and start a development server. You can now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app running.

## Understanding Components

React is all about components. They are the building blocks of your UI.

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

Components can be composed together to create complex UIs.
